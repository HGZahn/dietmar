## Description
The idea of this theme is to contain a lot of info in a small string, by compressing some parts and colorcoding, which bring useful visual cues, while limiting the amount of colors and such to keep it easy on the eyes.
When a command exited >0, the timestamp will be in red and the exit code will be on the right edge.
If you are connected via ssh there will be a notification.

## Install
Antigen:
insert into .zshrc  
 `antigen theme HGZahn/dietmar`
